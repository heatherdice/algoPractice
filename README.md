# algoPractice
## Solutions to algorithms.
Algorithms found on Coding Dojo Learn Platform, LeetCode, CodeSignal, HackerRank, and more.
This practice is meant to help me prepare for interviews as well as gain a greater understanding of JavaScript as a coding language.
At the end of each file, one can find notes on various things I have learned while solving these algorithms, along with explanations should review ever be needed.
